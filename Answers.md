1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS tries to solve the problem of building websites with user interfaces and lots of data simple and declarative.  This last part is important because declarative code is code that is componetized for easy reuse and is more-easily readable by programmers who have to understand what the code is supposed to do.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in React means to break down every facet of a given project into its smallest component, and to program in such a way so that every component is responsible only for those things within its scope.

3. Describe state.

State describes the current status of an application as defined by the data it's currently holding.

4. Describe props.

Props is data from state passed down from parent to child (and grandchild, etc.) components for the application to work on and render results from.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

A side-effect is annything that effects something from outside the scope of the function being executed.  In React, these can be synced with the React Hook, useEffect().
